# UTCHS Test Summary

This document summarizes the current test coverage for the UTCHS framework, with a specific focus on the recent testing of the infinite pattern detection capabilities.

## 1. Meta Pattern Detector Tests

Tests for the `MetaPatternDetector` module focus on verifying the detection of recursive 3-6-9 patterns that generate complete 13D systems across multiple scales.

### Test Coverage

‚úÖ **Meta-Position Cycle Calculation**: Verified that the `_calculate_meta_position_cycle` method correctly calculates cycle numbers corresponding to meta-positions at different recursion orders, following the formula:
  - Meta‚Çç‚Çô‚Çé(3) = Cycle(3 √ó 2‚Åø‚Åª¬π)
  - Meta‚Çç‚Çô‚Çé(6) = Cycle(6 √ó 2‚Åø‚Åª¬π)
  - Meta‚Çç‚Çô‚Çé(9) = Cycle(9 √ó 2‚Åø‚Åª¬π)

‚úÖ **Meta-Position Determination**: Verified that the `_determine_meta_position` method correctly identifies which meta-position a given cycle corresponds to at different recursion orders.

‚úÖ **Meta-Pattern Detection**: Tested the calculation of meta-cycle values for recursion order 2 and 3, confirming that:
  - At recursion order 2, the meta-positions 3, 6, 9 correspond to cycles 6, 12, 18
  - At recursion order 3, the meta-positions 3, 6, 9 correspond to cycles 12, 24, 36

‚úÖ **Dimensional System Detection**: Tested the detection of complete 13D systems emerging at key cycles:
  - The first meta-level 13D system emerges at cycle 6
  - The second meta-level 13D system emerges at cycle 12
  - Each higher recursion order follows the same doubling pattern

‚úÖ **Prediction Capabilities**: Tested that the detector can accurately predict higher-order patterns based on observed patterns, verifying predictions up to recursion order 5.

### Future Test Plans

üîÑ **Integration Tests**: Need to create integration tests that validate the detection of patterns in simulated system evolutions.

üîÑ **Cross-Scale Correlation**: Need to test the analysis of correlations between patterns at different recursion levels.

üîÑ **System Generation Visualization**: Need to create tests for the visualization of nested 13D systems.

üîÑ **Refactoring Tests**: When the `MetaPatternDetector` is renamed to `CompleteSystemDetector`, tests will need to be updated to reflect this change.

## 2. Other Module Tests

### Core Module Tests
- System
- Cycle
- Position
- Torus

### Mathematics Module Tests
- Mobius Node

### Validation Tests
- Validation Registry

## 3. Test Execution

The tests can be run using:

```bash
# Run all tests
python run_tests.py

# Run only the meta pattern detector tests
python run_meta_pattern_tests.py 

# Run specific tests with pytest
pytest -xvs tests/test_meta_pattern_detector.py
```

## 4. Test Environment

The test environment includes:

- Synthetic data generation for testing meta-pattern detection
- Mocked position history data that simulates the 3-6-9 pattern across multiple recursion levels
- Validation utilities for verifying the correctness of results

## 5. Next Steps

1. Create visual verification tests for nested 13D system visualization
2. Add tests for system-to-system relationship analysis
3. Update tests to reflect rename from MetaPatternDetector to CompleteSystemDetector
4. Add tests for interference pattern detection between systems
5. Add tests for time-to-emergence estimation for future 13D systems
