# UTCHS Infinite Pattern Detection: Implementation Tracker

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of infinite recursive pattern detection in the UTCHS framework. This extends the current meta-pattern detection to handle an arbitrary number of recursion levels, capturing the "patterns within patterns within patterns" nature of the system.

## Conceptual Framework

The system exhibits recursive 3-6-9 patterns across potentially infinite levels:

1. **Base Level (n=1)**: Original positions 3, 6, 9
2. **Meta Level (n=2)**: Cycles 6, 12, 18 as meta-positions 3, 6, 9
3. **Meta-Meta Level (n=3)**: Cycles 12, 24, 36 as meta-meta-positions 3, 6, 9
4. **And so on...**

This follows the mathematical pattern:
- Meta₍ₙ₎(3) = Cycle(3 × 2ⁿ⁻¹)
- Meta₍ₙ₎(6) = Cycle(6 × 2ⁿ⁻¹)
- Meta₍ₙ₎(9) = Cycle(9 × 2ⁿ⁻¹)

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 2: Visualization & Analysis

- [ ] Design multi-level pattern visualization

### Phase 3: Predictive Capabilities

## Outstanding Issues

1. Need to develop visualization approach for multiple levels (highest priority)
2. Need to implement time-to-emergence estimation for future patterns
3. Need to add stability metrics for different recursion levels
4. Need to develop interference pattern detection between levels

## Next Steps

1. Create visualization module for multi-level patterns:
   - Design hierarchical pattern display showing all recursion levels
   - Implement transition diagrams showing propagation between levels
   - Add interactive visualization components

2. Implement time-to-emergence estimation:
   - Create model to predict emergence times for higher-order patterns
   - Validate predictions against actual observation data

3. Enhance stability analysis:
   - Create metrics to evaluate stability of patterns at different recursion levels
   - Compare stability across recursion orders

4. Develop interference pattern detection:
   - Create algorithm to detect interference between recursion levels
   - Visualize interference patterns and their effects
